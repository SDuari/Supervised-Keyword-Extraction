# Keyword Extraction from Hindi Text

Hindi is the most widely spoken Indian Language. Though the language is rich in literature, it is not supported by effecient and sophisticated NLP tools. To overcome this, we used the XGBoost2 model trained on English corpora to extract keywords from Hindi documents and observed that the model is capable of predicting keywords from cross-lingual text.
