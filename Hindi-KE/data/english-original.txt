Movie review: A classic haunted-house tale in ""Insidious""
If horror movies are about the unexpected, then ""Insidious"" delivers the last thing you would expect: Restrained chills from the guys who launched the ""Saw"" franchise. Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell, who gave us the original ""Saw"" (which is better than you remember), reteam for this update on the classic haunted-house thriller - which uses its creaking noises and fast shocks to good effect. Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) move into a new house with their three kids. But domestic bliss is shortlived, when oldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) falls into a coma, which has no medical explanation. Renai comes to believe that what's happening is supernatural - and even convinces Josh to move the family to a new house. Moving doesn't help, as the dark forces follow the family. ""It's not the house that's haunted - it's your son,"" gravely explains Elise, a no-nonsense psychic played by screen veteran Lin Shaye, who steals the movie. Wan ratchets up the old-school shocks, starting with the occasional door slam and building to a chaotic finale that bridges the real world and a deathly realm cryptically called ""The Further."" Whannell's script is leavened by the comic relief of two nerdy paranormal investigators, played by Whannell and Angus Sampson. ""Insidious"" is the rare example of a PG-13 movie that delivers genuine chills, without excessive blood and gore. The images are fleeting, but tough to shake.
